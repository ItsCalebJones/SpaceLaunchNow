# SpaceLaunchNow
A space launch tracker for Android using data from the Launch Library API, the current roadmap can be viewed on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DwLCfv7g/space-launch-now).

## Data Sources

A majority of the data is currently sourced from [Launch Libary](https://launchlibrary.net/) a wonderful set of API's and Librarians that are constantly tracking and updating launches around the world. Until Launch Library provides image links and details for launch vehicles I am hosting a JSON file [here](http://calebjones.me/app/launchvehicle.json) that is a static list of data from [Planet 4589](http://www.planet4589.org/space/lvdb/lv.html) with some extra data.
